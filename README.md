# Code Description
This JavaScript program is designed to validate, reverse, and store passwords in an object. First, it checks if two passwords match and meet the required conditions (at least 8 characters long, containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number). Second, it includes a function to reverse the password. Lastly, it stores the password in an objectâ€”if the password is valid, it stores the reversed version; otherwise, it keeps the original password.

# Things you did in the code
The first thing I did was used a for loop to validate the password. Since regular expression or RegExp weren't allowed to use, I just simply used for loops for each condition to check if the password contains an uppercase, lowercase letter, and a number.
The next thing I did I did is to implement string reversal using a loop, I actually search on how to do it because I have no idea how (see for my references attached). Lastly, I created an object to store the password. If the password is valid, I stored the reversed password in an object. If not, I stored the original password.


# Challenges encountered
The challenge I encountered was the loops in checking multiple conditions in password such as matching passwords, correct length, and required character types. At first, mali yung mga narereturn but then I still made it
